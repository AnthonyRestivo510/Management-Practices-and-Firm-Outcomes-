# Management-Practices-and-Firm-Outcomes-
This project comes from the data set of Macchiavello and Morjaria focusses on ownership changes and the activity within the firm in Rwanda's coffee industry. Reporting how domestic and foreign acquisitions compare through multiple factors. Ultimately, the project highlights data cleaning, visualization and reproducible analysis through RMarkdown. 
Foreign Ownership and Firm Performance (R)

🎯 Research Question

Do ownership changes improve firm performance, and does the effect differ between domestic and foreign acquisitions?

📊 Data

Firm-level panel data on Rwandan coffee mills

Covers:

Ownership status (stand-alone, domestic group, foreign group)

Output, capacity utilization, labor usage, and input efficiency

Time span: multiple years (staggered acquisition timing)

Data are used for academic replication and demonstration purposes only.

🧪 Methodology

Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with:

Firm fixed effects

Year fixed effects

Event-study style comparisons around acquisition timing

Outcome measures include:

Capacity utilization

Input efficiency (capital, labor, raw materials)

Operational performance indicators

All analysis is conducted in R using reproducible workflows.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

R

RStudio

RMarkdown

tidyverse

fixest / plm

ggplot2

📈 Key Findings (Summary)

Ownership changes alone do not guarantee improved performance

Firms acquired by foreign owners show:

Higher capacity utilization

Improved input efficiency

Domestic acquisitions show limited or no efficiency gains

Results align with the hypothesis that implementation of management practices—not just ownership—drives performance differences
